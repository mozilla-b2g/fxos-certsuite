    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>
        This test is only useful on devices that expose the BatteryManager interface,
        but lack a backend implementation.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This test validates that all of the navigator.battery attributes exist and are set to their default values.
    </p>
    <h2>Preconditions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The implementation is unable to report the battery's charging state,
        charging time, level or remaining time respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        The device is unplugged from the charger before this test case is run.
      </li>
    </ol>
