    This will repeatedly evaluate a condition in anticipation for a
    truthy return value, or its timeout to expire, or its waiting
    predicate to become true.

    A ``Wait`` instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for
    a condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the
    condition.  Furthermore, the user may configure the wait to ignore
    specific types of exceptions whilst waiting.

        Optionally a different time implementation than the one
        provided by the standard library (time, through
        ``SystemClock``) can also be provided.

        Sample usage::

            # Wait 30 seconds for condition to return "foo", checking
            # it every 5 seconds.
            wait = Wait(timeout=30, interval=5)

            to become true.  The default timeout is
            `wait.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.

        :param interval: How often the condition should be evaluated.
            In reality the interval may be greater as the cost of
            evaluating the condition function is not factored in.  The
            default polling interval is `wait.DEFAULT_INTERVAL`.

        :param ignored_exceptions: Ignore specific types of exceptions
            whilst waiting for the condition.  Any exceptions not
            whitelisted will be allowed to propagate, terminating the
            wait.

        :param clock: Allows overriding the use of the runtime's
            default time library.  See ``wait.SystemClock`` for
            implementation details.
