    This is a test for the `WebTelephony API`_ which will:

    - Setup a mozTelephony event listener for incoming calls
    - Ask the test user to phone the Firefox OS device from a second phone
    - Verify that the mozTelephony incoming call event is triggered
    - Answer the incoming call via the API, keep the call active for 5 seconds
    - Ask the test user to hang up the call from second phone
    - Verify that the corresponding mozTelephonyCall event is triggered
    - Re-enable the default gaia dialer
