    This is a test for the `WebTelephony API`_ which will:

    - Disable the default gaia dialer, so that the test app can handle calls
    - Ask the test user to specify a destination phone number for the test call
    - Setup mozTelephonyCall event listeners for the outgoing call
    - Use the API to initiate the outgoing call
    - Ask the test user to answer the call on the destination phone
    - Keep the call active for 5 seconds, then hang up the call via the API
    - Verify that the corresponding mozTelephonyCall events were triggered
    - Re-enable the default gaia dialer
